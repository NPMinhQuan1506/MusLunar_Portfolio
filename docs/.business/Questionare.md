* **Hosting, domain, services:** 3–5 million VND/year (fixed, mandatory costs for a professional portfolio)
* **AI Agent service:** 6 - 8 million VND/year
* **Time investment:** 9h/week × 48 weeks ≈ **432h/year**

---

## 2. **Long-term Benefits**

### **a) Higher chance of landing a good job**

* Recruiters love candidates with a personalized portfolio, showing real projects, contributions, practical skills, and product mindset
* A good portfolio helps you pass CV screening at many large companies (because it’s outstanding, visual, and easy to assess)
* Increases chances of interview calls, and offers for higher salaries (because you prove your value, not just claim it on your CV)

### **b) More freelance/remote job opportunities**

* Clients and agencies often require a portfolio for big projects, especially in overseas markets (Upwork, LinkedIn, Behance, GitHub, etc.)
* A great portfolio gets you more cooperation offers and lets you pick up 1–2 side jobs/year (each worth several to tens of millions)

### **c) Builds personal brand and long-term career development**

* Makes a personal impression in the industry, helps you build a professional network
* Leads to opportunities like training, mentoring, consulting, even CTO/lead roles
* Can turn into your own product/service (blog for money, opening courses, selling plugins/services, etc.)

### **d) Skill development**

* Building a portfolio sharpens your UI/UX, content writing, SEO, DevOps, and even mini-project management skills
* Many devs improve product thinking, coding, CI/CD, deployment, cloud skills after building their portfolio

### **e) Proactively choosing and negotiating your own value**

* With a portfolio, you “lead the game”: recruiters/clients contact you, not the other way around like with mass CV applications
* You can “raise” your job/salary deal to match your true market value, boosting your confidence and negotiation

## 3. **Cost–Benefit Analysis**

### **Benefit–Cost Comparison**

#### **A. “Average Success” Scenario**

* 1 small freelance job/year: \~10 million
* 1 better full-time job: salary increase \~3 million/month = 36 million/year
* Learning new skills, building personal brand (hard to quantify, but a big intangible asset)

**Minimum total benefit after 1 year:**

> 10 million (freelance) + 36 million (full-time) = **46 million**
> (not including intangible benefits & further opportunities)

#### **B. “Outstanding Success” Scenario**

* 2–3 freelance jobs: 30–60 million/year
* Job-hopping with big salary increases, or promotion to lead: +60–100 million/year
* Building a personal brand, growing your network → long-term value “incalculable”

**Total benefit:**

> 50–150 million++/year (could be even more if fully leveraged)

#### **C. “Failure” Scenario**

* No new jobs, no freelance work, only new skills/experience gained
* Lost 9–11 million + opportunity cost
* But can still use the experience and reinvest next year

---

## 4. **Conclusion**

### **Do the long-term benefits outweigh the costs/risks?**

* **YES (very clear!)**
* Even if you can’t recoup all costs in the first year, **accumulated value, personal brand, skills, and network** will repay you many times over in the long run
* If you take it seriously, “breaking even” or even making a profit in the first year is totally realistic
