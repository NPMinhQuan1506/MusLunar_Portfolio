## 6. Cost, Risks & Benefit Analysis

- **Actual Costs:**  
  - Hosting/domain/services: 3–5m VND/year  
  - Time: 432h/year (9h x 48w)  
  - Opportunity cost: ~60–86m VND/year (if time used elsewhere)
- **Risks:**  
  - Low view, few clients
  - Portfolio not attractive/market fit
  - Many competitors, must update continuously
  - Lost investment if wrong direction
- **Benefit Estimate:**  
  - Average: 1 freelance job (10m) + 1 better job (36m) = 46m VND/year (excluding branding!)
  - Outstanding: 2–3 freelance (30–60m) + major job jump (60–100m) + brand equity
  - Worst case: only skill/experience gained, can reinvest next year
- **Conclusion:**  
  → Long-term benefits **clearly** outweigh risks/costs  
  → Even “break-even” in year 1 is realistic if done seriously
