| **Planned Launch** | **May 01, 2026** |

## 1. Executive Summary
**Background:** The team (Developer & Designer) currently lacks a unified digital presence. Individual portfolios fail to demonstrate the unique combination of logical engineering (Go/Backend) and creative design (3D/Animation).
**Purpose:** Develop "MusLunar," an interactive web platform merging these two identities. The project aims to convert visitors into high-value clients/recruiters by showcasing technical depth and creative flair in a single product.

## 2. Project Objectives (SMART)
1.  **Product:** Deliver a fully functional dual-persona website with e-commerce capability by **May 01, 2026**.
2.  **Performance:** Achieve a Google Lighthouse score of **>90** (Performance, SEO) to prove technical competence.
3.  **Engagement:** Implement gamification (Interactive Timeline) to maintain average session duration **>2 minutes**.
4.  **Conversion:** Generate at least **1 qualified lead** (Job offer or Freelance contract) within 3 months of launch.

## 3. Scope Definition

### **In Scope (Deliverables)**
*   **Dual-Interface System:** "Drag-to-switch" mechanism between Developer (Logic) and Designer (Creative) modes.
*   **Portfolio Showcase:** Project listing with role-based filtering.
*   **E-commerce Module:** Shop system for Digital/Physical goods (Manual/QR Payment).
*   **Gamification:** Interactive career timeline.
*   **CMS (Admin Panel):** Dashboard to manage projects, blogs, and orders.
*   **Localization:** Multi-language (Vietnamese / English) & Dark/Light/Pixel Themes.

### **Out of Scope (Exclusions)**
*   **Public Registration:** No community sign-up (Admin & Recruiter access only).
*   **Automated Payment:** No Stripe/PayPal integration in v1.0.
*   **Advanced AI:** No self-learning personalization engines.

## 4. Key Stakeholders
| Role | Name | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sponsor / Lead Dev** | Quan Nguyen | Funding, Architecture, Backend (Go), Frontend Logic. |
| **Creative Director** | Nguyet Nguyen | UI/UX Design, 3D Assets, Visual QA. |
| **End Users** | Clients / Recruiters | The target audience. |

## 5. Constraints & Assumptions
*   **Budget:** Capped at **5,000,000 VND/year** (Includes Ops & Buffer).
*   **Resources:** 2 members, part-time commitment (~9h/week).
*   **Tech Stack:** Must use **Go (Golang)** for Backend and **Next.js** for Frontend.
*   **Assumption:** Design assets will be delivered on time to match the aggressive coding schedule.

## 6. Milestones (Schedule)
*Strict adherence to the original timeline.*

| Phase | Deliverables | Deadline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kick-off** | Architecture Frozen, DB Schema, Repo Init. | **Dec 08, 2025** *(Completed)* |
| **Sprint 1 (MVP)** | Role Selector, Dual Home, Projects, Contact, Basic Auth. | **Dec 31, 2025** |
| **Sprint 2 (Full)** | Shop, Gamified Timeline, Blog, Chatbot, i18n. | **Mar 27, 2026** |
| **Sprint 3 (CMS)** | Complete Admin Dashboard, Analytics integration. | **Apr 30, 2026** |
| **Public Launch** | Social Announcement, Marketing push. | **May 01, 2026** |

## 7. Key Risks & Mitigation
| Risk Description | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aggressive MVP Timeline:** Only ~3 weeks for Sprint 1 with new tech. | High | **Strict Scope Control:** No new features allowed. Use placeholder UI if design is delayed. |
| **Go Learning Curve:** Learning backend while building may slow progress. | Medium | Stick to Clean Architecture. Use `sqlc` for type-safe SQL to avoid runtime errors. |
| **Infrastructure:** Maintenance of self-hosted VPS. | Medium | Automate deployment via GitHub Actions; Keep DB on Managed Service (Supabase) to reduce risk. |

## 8. Budget Allocation
*   **Infrastructure (VPS/Domain):** ~2,000,000 VND.
*   **Buffer (Ads/Assets):** ~3,000,000 VND.
*   **Total:** **5,000,000 VND**.
