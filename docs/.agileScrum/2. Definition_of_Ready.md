| 2 | **Acceptance Criteria** | Key functionalities are listed as bullet points (clear pass/fail conditions). |
| 3 | **Design / Assets** | Figma screen is ready. **Crucial:** 3D models/Icons/Images are exported and available in Drive/Repo. |
| 4 | **API / Schema** | For Backend tasks: DB Schema & API JSON format are defined (matches `API_SPECS.md`). |
