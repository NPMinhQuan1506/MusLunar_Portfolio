# Kanban Workflow - MusLunar Portfolio

## 1. Board Columns (Notion)
- **Backlog:** Ideas and requirements not yet detailed.
- **Design:** Active phase for UI/UX work and Asset preparation.
- **Ready (DoR met):** Tasks with clear requirements, assets exported/available, and approved priority.
- **In Progress:** Actively being coded. Max 2 items per person to focus effort.
- **Review:** Code is deployed to Vercel Preview (FE) or tested on Staging (BE). Designer reviews UI.
- **Done (DoD met):** Merged to main branch; deployed to Production (Vercel/VPS); fully functional.

## 2. Policies
- **Pull System:** Only move tasks to "In Progress" when you have capacity.
- **WIP Limit:** Focus on finishing tasks before starting new ones (Stop starting, start finishing).
- **Blockers:** If a task is blocked (e.g., missing API or Asset), flag it immediately in the Telegram group.
- **Handover:** Designer must export assets (images, icons, 3D models) to the shared Drive/Repo before moving a task to "Ready" for Dev.

## 3. Cadence & Rituals
- **Weekly Planning (Sunday):** Review progress, reprioritize Backlog, move items to Ready.
- **Daily Sync (Async):** Quick updates via Telegram (no formal meeting required).
- **Design Review:** Before merging to main, the Developer sends the Preview link to the Designer for visual QA.

## 4. Tools
- **Tracking:** Notion Board (Primary).
- **Communication:** Telegram Group (Urgent discussions & Notifications).
- **Design:** Figma (UI/UX source).
- **Code:** GitHub (Single Repository).
