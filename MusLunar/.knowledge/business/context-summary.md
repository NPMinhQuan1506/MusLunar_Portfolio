# Business Problem
- Need a frontend that showcases the MusLunar portfolio dynamically (projects, role-based views) without manual page edits.
- Must personalize UX per role (recruiter/client/viewer) and stay performant on edge deployment (Vercel).

# Pain Points
- Static updates cause stale project info and inconsistent messaging across roles/locales.
- Contact/engagement paths are inconsistent; no unified UX to drive conversions.
- Missing shared guidance on UX/UI patterns, leading to fragmented design and code style.

# Business Objectives
- Deliver a fast, role-aware landing experience with clear project discovery and contact flows.
- Keep content/API-driven so non-dev updates flow through backend/API without redeploying frontend.
- Maintain a lightweight design system (shadcn-ready) to accelerate component reuse and keep branding consistent.
- Ensure onboarding time for new frontend contributors is <1 day via clear docs and structure.
